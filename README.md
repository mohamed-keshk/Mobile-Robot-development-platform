# Open Source Mobile Robot development platform

![Mobile Robot Render](/Photos/Render_2.JPG "A SolidWorks render of the Mobile Robot")

### Originally designed to be a part of a swarm that will be deployed in factories or warehouses or otherwise.
- The chassis is made of aluminum extrusion
- A linear actuator that lifts the center platform to move palettes around.
- Mecanum wheels where used to allow for maximum degrees of freedom.
- The control Is based on a Jetson Nano
- Included some sensors such as RPLIDAR A1

A list of all the components and links to each one will be available in the BOM shortly.

Soon I'll be uploading all the Mechanical designs, STL files, code and schematics.
